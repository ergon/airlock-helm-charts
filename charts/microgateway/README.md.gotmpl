## Introduction
This Helm chart bootstraps [Airlock Microgateway](https://www.airlock.com) on a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) or [Openshift](https://www.openshift.com) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager. It provisions an Airlock Microgateway Pod with a default configuration that can be adjusted to customer needs. For more details about the configuration options, see chapter [Helm Configuration](#dsl-configuration).

## Prerequisites
* The Airlock Microgateway image
* A valid license for Airlock Microgateway
* Redis service for session handling (see chapter [Dependencies](#dependencies))

## Quick start guide
The following subchapters describe how to use the Helm chart.

### Adding the chart repository
To add the chart repository:

  ```console
  helm repo add airlock https://ergon.github.io/airlock-helm-charts/
  ```

### Installing the chart
To install the chart with the release name `microgateway`:

  ```console
  helm upgrade -i microgateway airlock/microgateway -f license.yaml
  ```

:exclamation: Airlock Microgateway will not work without a valid license. To order one, please contact sales@airlock.com.

### Uninstalling the chart
To uninstall the chart with the release name `microgateway`:

  ```console
  helm uninstall microgateway
  ```

## Configuration
The following table lists configuration parameters of the Airlock Microgateway chart and the default values.

{{ template "chart.valuesTable" . }}

## Getting started
This chapter provides information how to get started with the Helm chart.

### Override default values
The Airlock Microgateway Helm chart has many parameters and most of them are already equipped with default values (see [Configuration](#configuration)). Depending on the environment, the defaults must be adapted. To override default values, do the following:

* Create a YAML file that contains the values that differ to the default.
* Apply this YAML file with the `-f` parameter.

**Example:**

  custom-values.yaml
  ```
  config:
    simple:
      backend:
        hostname: custom-backend-service
    generic:
      existingSecret: "microgateway-secrets"
  imagePullSecrets:
    - name: "docker-secret"
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    hosts:
      - example.virtinc.com
  ```

  Afterwards apply the Helm chart configuration file with the `-f` parameter.
  ```console
  helm upgrade -i microgateway airlock/microgateway -f custom-values.yaml
  ```

:point_up: **YAML indentation**:<br>
YAML is very strict with indentation. To ensure that the YAML file itself is correct, check it's content with a YAML validator (e.g. [YAML Lint](http://www.yamllint.com/)).

## Dependencies
The Airlock Microgateway Helm chart has the following optional dependencies, which can be enabled for a smooth start.

{{ template "chart.requirementsTable" . }}

### Redis
In case that session handling is enabled on Airlock Microgateway, a Redis service needs to be available. The Airlock Microgateway Helm chart has two options:
* To deploy the dependent Redis service, adapt the Helm chart configuration as shown below:
  custom-values.yaml
  ```
  redis:
    enabled: true
  ```
* To use an existing Redis service, adapt the Helm chart configuration as shown below:
  custom-values.yaml
  ```
  config:
    global:
      redisService: [ <REDIS-SERVICE>:<PORT> ]
  redis:
    enabled: false
  ```

Finally, apply the Helm chart configuration file with `-f` parameter.

  ```console
  helm upgrade -i microgateway airlock/microgateway -f custom-values.yaml
  ```

:information_source: **Possible settings**:<br>
Please refer to the [Redis Helm chart](https://hub.helm.sh/charts/bitnami/redis) to see all possible parameters of the Redis Helm chart.

:warning: **Adjustments of the default settings**:<br>
The delivered Helm chart comes pre-configured and tested for the dependent Redis service. Adjusting those settings can cause issues.

### Echo-Server
For the first deployment, it could be very useful to have a backend service processing requests. For this purpose the dependent Echo-Server can be deployed by doing the following:
  custom-values.yaml
  ```
  echo-server:
    enabled: true
  ```

Finally, apply the Helm chart configuration file with `-f` parameter.

  ```console
  helm upgrade -i microgateway airlock/microgateway -f custom-values.yaml
  ```

:information_source: **Possible settings**:<br>
Please refer to the [Echo-Server Helm chart](https://ealenn.github.io/Echo-Server/pages/helm.html) to see all possible parameters of the Echo-Server Helm chart.

## DSL configuration
The Helm chart provides three different possibilities to configure the Microgateway.
Depending on the environment and use case, one of the options might suit better and be easier to implement.

### Simple DSL configuration
The simple DSL configuration suites best for the following use case:
| Virtual Host | Mapping | Backend Service |
|--|--|--|
| VH1 (hostname: virtinc.com) | M1 (entryPath: /) | BE1 |

Restrictions for Simple DSL configuration:
* Only one Virtual Host is configured.
* Only one Mapping is configured.
* Only one backend service is configured.

By default, the Airlock Microgateway is configured with the [Simple DSL configuration](#simple-dsl-configuration). The example below shows how to adjust the default values:

**Example:**

  custom-values.yaml
  ```
  config:
    global:
      IPHeader:
        trustedProxies:
          - 10.0.0.0/28
    simple:
      mapping:
        entryPath: /
        operationalMode: integration
        denyRules:
          level: strict
          exceptions:
            - parameter_name:
                pattern: ^content$
                ignore_case: true
              path:
                pattern: ^/mail/
              method:
                pattern: ^POST$
      backend:
        protocol: https
        hostname: custom-backend-service
        port: 8443
  
  redis:
    enabled: true
  ```

**`config.*` Parameters which can be used**:
* `config.simple.*`
* `config.global.*`
* `config.generic.*`

### Advanced DSL configuration
In case that the [Simple DSL configuration](#simple-dsl-configuration) does not suite, the advanced configuration options might help. The following use cases might require this kind of configuration:

**_Use Case 1)_**
| Virtual Host | Mapping | Backend Service |
|--|--|--|
| VH1 (hostname: virtinc.com) | M1 (entryPath: /) | BE1 |
| VH2 (hostname: example.com) | M2 (entryPath: /) | BE1 |

**_Use Case 2)_**
| Virtual Host | Mapping | Backend Service |
|--|--|--|
| VH1 (hostname: virtinc.com) | M1 (entryPath: /)<br>M2 (entryPath: /auth/) | BE1 |

**_Use Case 3)_**
| Virtual Host | Mapping | Backend Service |
|--|--|--|
| VH1 (hostname: virtinc.com) | M1 (entryPath: /) | BE1 |
| VH2 (hostname: example.com) | M2 (entryPath: /) | BE2 |

The use cases outlined above can also occur slightly differently. But all of them have in common that more than one Virtual Hosts, Mappings or Backend Services are used. Whenever this is the case, the [Advanced DSL configuration](#advanced-dsl-configuration) should be preferred over the [Simple DSL configuration](#simple-dsl-configuration).

**Example:**

  custom-values.yaml
  ```
  config:
    global:
      IPHeader:
        trustedProxies:
          - 10.0.0.0/28
    advanced:
      apps:
        - virtual_host:
            hostname: virtinc.com
          mappings:
            - name: webapp
              entry_path: /
              operational_mode: integration
              session_handling: enforce_session
              denyRules:
                level: standard
                exceptions:
                  - parameter_name:
                      pattern: ^content$
                      ignore_case: true
                    path:
                      pattern: ^/mail/
                    method:
                      pattern: ^POST$
            - name: api
              entry_path: /api/
              session_handling: ignore_session
              denyRules:
                level: strict
              openapi:
                spec_file: /config/virtinc_api_openapi.json
          backend:
            protocol: https
            hostname: custom-backend-service
            port: 8443
  
  redis:
    enabled: true
  ```

**`config.*` Parameters which can be used**:
* `config.advanced.apps` - **must** be used.
* `config.global.*`
* `config.generic.*`

### Expert DSL configuration
In case that the [Advanced DSL configuration](#advanced-dsl-configuration) does not suite, the expert configuration options must be used. There are a few reasons listed below:

* The Microgateway DSL configuration options are not available as Helm chart parameters (e.g. base_template_file, session.store_mode, ...)
* The Microgateway DSL configuration file has already been used/tested thorougly. To reduce the risk of a broken or unsecure configuration, do not modify the pre-configured configuration file.


**Example:**

  custom-values.yaml
  ```
  config:
    expert:
      dsl:
        base_template_file: /config/custom-base.xml
        license_file: /secret/config/license
        session:
          encryption_passphrase_file: /secret/config/passphrase
          redis_hosts: [ redis-master ]
        log:
          level: info
        expert_settings:
          apache: |
            RemoteIPHeader X-Forwarded-For
            RemoteIPInternalProxy 10.0.0.0/28
          
        apps:
          - virtual_host:
              hostname: virtinc.com
            mappings:
              - name: webapp
                entry_path: /
                operational_mode: integration
                session_handling: enforce_session
              - name: api
                entry_path: /api/
                session_handling: ignore_session
                openapi:
                  spec_file: /config/virtinc_api_openapi.json
            backend:
              protocol: https
              hostname: custom-backend-service
              port: 8443
  
  redis:
    enabled: true
  
  ```

**`config.*` Parameters which can be used**:
* `config.expert.dsl - **must** be used.
* `config.generic.*`

## Environment variables
Environment variables can be configured with the Helm chart and used within the [DSL Configuration](#dsl-configuration).
This works for all three DSL of the above configuration setups (simple, advanced and expert). The example below illustrates how to configure environment variables in combination with the [Simple DSL configuration](#simple-dsl-configuration).

  env-variables.yaml
  ```
  config:
    generic:
      env:
        - name: WAF_CFG_OPERATIONALMODE
          value: production
        - name: WAF_CFG_LOGONLY
          value: false
  ```

  custom-values.yaml
  ```
  config:
    simple:
      mapping:
        operationalMode: "@@WAF_CFG_OPERATIONALMODE@@"
        denyRules:
          logOnly: "@@WAF_CFG_LOGONLY@@"
  ```

Finally, apply the Helm chart configuration file with `-f` parameter.

  ```console
  helm upgrade -i microgateway airlock/microgateway -f custom-values.yaml -f env-variables.yaml
  ```

## Extra Volumes
The Helm chart allows you to define extra volumes which can be used in the Microgateway. 
The configuration of such additional volumes could look like this: 

```
extraVolumes:
  - name: mapping
    configMap:
      name: mapping-configmap
extraVolumeMounts:
  - name: mapping
    mountPath: /config/template/mapping.xml
    subPath: mapping.xml

config:
  advanced:
    apps:
      - mappings:
        - name: virtinc
          mapping_template_path: /config/template/mapping.xml   
```

## Probes
Probes are used in Kubernetes and Openshift to determine if a Pod is ready and in good health to process requests.

### Readiness Probe
The readiness probe determines whether a Pod is ready to process requests. This means that requests are only forwarded to this Pod once it is in ready state.

The Helm chart is already pre-configured for the readiness probe endpoint of the Microgateway Pod. A huge Microgateway configuration could require to increase the initial delay time. This can be accomplished by configuring the following parameter:

  ```
  readinessProbe:
    initialDelaySeconds: 90
  ```

If desired, the readiness probe can be disabled with `readinessProbe.enabled=false`. This way, the Pod is ready immediately and receives requests.

### Liveness Probe
The liveness Probe determines whether a Pod is in good health. If the liveness probe fails, the Pod is terminated and new one is started.

The Helm chart is already pre-configured for the liveness probe endpoint of the Microgateway Pod. A huge Microgateway configuration could require to increase the initial delay time. This can be accomplished by configuring the following parameter:

  ```
  livenessProbe:
    initialDelaySeconds: 120
  ```

If desired, the liveness probe can be disabled with `livenessProbe.enabled=false`.

## External connectivity
The Helm chart can be configured to create a Kubernetes Ingress or Openshift Route to pass external traffic to the Microgateway Pod.
In case that those objects were created with this Helm chart, just follow along with the description and configuration examples. 
If there is already an existing Ingress or Route object and the traffic should only be passed to the Microgateway service, the information in the subchapters should provide useful information about how to integrate into the existing environment.

:information_source: **Kubernetes vs. Openshift**:<br>
This Helm chart can be used for Kubernetes and Openshift. While Kubernetes has "Ingress" and Openshift has "Route", simply enable the feature which fits to the environment (e.g. in Kubernetes `ingress.enabled=true` and in Openshift `route.enabled=true`).

### Kubernetes Ingress
Kubernetes allows using different kinds of Ingress controllers. Our examples are based on the [nginx-ingress](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/nginx-ingress) controller.

  The example below shows how to install the nginx-ingress-controller with Helm:
  ```
  helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com
  helm install nginx stable/nginx-ingress
  ```

:information_source: **Note**:<br>
The Microgateway Helm chart itself does not install the nginx-ingress-controller, but allows to create an Ingress object.

#### Ingress terminating HTTP

  To receive HTTP traffic from the outside of the Kubernetes cluster, use the following configuration:
  ```
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    annotations:
      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
      kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    hosts:
        - virtinc.com
  ```

#### Ingress terminating secure HTTPS
The TLS certificate of the Ingress must be in a secret object which is referred to in the Ingress configuration.
At the time of writing, Ingress supports only the default port 443 for HTTPS and directly assumes it is TLS.
In case that multiple hosts are configured, TLS-SNI is used to distinguish what host the client requested.

  To receive HTTPS traffic from the outside of the Kubernetes cluster, use the following configuration:
  ```
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    annotations:
      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
      kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    targetPort: https
    tls:
      - secretName: virtinc-tls-secret
        hosts:
          - virtinc.com
  ```

### Openshift Route
Since the Route is already available in an Openshift environment, nothing has to be installed additionally.

#### Route terminating HTTP

  To receive HTTP traffic from the outside of the Openshift cluster, use the following configuration:
  ```
  route:
    enabled: true
    hosts:
      - virtinc.com
    targetPort: http
    tls:
      enabled: false
  ```

#### Route terminating secure HTTPS
Openshift has three different TLS termination types that can be used. Edge, re-encrypt and passthrough.
The subchapters provide the required information to configure it, using the Microgateway Helm chart.

##### Route Edge configuration
With the TLS termination type "Edge", HTTPS traffic is terminated on the Openshift Router.
Therefore, a valid certificate for the specified hosts must be applied.

  To setup Edge TLS termination, use the following configuration:
  ```
  route:
    enabled: true
    hosts:
      - virtinc.com
    tls:
      enabled: true
      termination: edge
      certificate: |
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        MIIDizCCAnOgAwIBAgIJAMQE1QewYs4QMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMFwxCzAJBgNV
        [...]
        77RRptcoQJPvw50z9rJ4wkrb58raUKOqxgvpckQdYdtok0dR6tXbBfC4LHmqq0mo
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
      key: |
        -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
        MIIEpAIBAAKCAQEAtXkTjHtDtutxyo1R6N4Eh18IzxoagAHPRzsdB5yeadcVr/bV
        [...]
        pGKu7aodwB4cD5YnfXTvUcTv5tNU0llRLG1J0bg1n9cCo0nTC9sUZw==
        -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
  ```

##### Route Re-encrypt configuration
With the TLS termination type "Re-encrypt", HTTPS is terminated on the Openshift Router and re-encrypted to the Microgateway service.
Because the default in the Microgateway Helm chart for `route.targetPort` is `https`, traffic inside the Openshift cluster is by default encrypted.
The difference to TLS termination type "Edge" is:
* The Microgateway certificate is validated against `route.tls.destinationCACertificate`.
* It is enforced, that `route.targetPort=https` (Edge would also work with `route.targetPort=http`)

In other words, the entire path of the connection is encrypted and verified, also within the Openshift cluster.

  To setup Re-encrypt TLS termination, use the following configuration:
  ```
  route:
    enabled: true
    hosts:
      - virtinc.com
    tls:
      enabled: true
      certificate: |
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        MIIDizCCAnOgAwIBAgIJAMQE1QewYs4QMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMFwxCzAJBgNV
        [...]
        77RRptcoQJPvw50z9rJ4wkrb58raUKOqxg4Jn=
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
      key: |
        -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
        MIIEpAIBAAKCAQEAtXkTjHtDtutxyo1R6N4Eh18IzxoagAHPRzsdB5yeadcVr/bV
        [...]
        pGKu7aodwB4cD5YnfXTvUcTv5tNU0llRLG1J0bg1n9cCo0nTC9sUZw==
        -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
      destinationCACertificate: | 
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        MIIDrIXdz54xcilsKUoepQkn9e0bmIUVuiXWcQrr8iqjYC+hINNmiq+4YX4lWq2M
        [...]
        K0RRA/rDxZnkbvtTd+hkoMu3Or+pqpOrp2n1pbtzoVl9Hg==
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  ```

##### Route Passthrough configuration
With the TLS termination type "Passthrough", HTTPS traffic is sent directly to the Microgateway, without decrypting it on the route.
Therefore, no certificates need to be configured on the Route and termination takes place in the Microgateway.

  To setup Passthrough TLS termination, use the following configuraion:
  ```
  route:
    enabled: true
    path: ""
    hosts:
      - virtinc.com
    tls:
      enabled: true
      termination: passthrough
      destinationCACertificate: ""
  ```

## Security
The following subchapters describes how to use and securely deploy the Microgateway.

### Store sensitive information in secrets
Airlock Microgateway uses a few sensitive information that should be protected accordingly. E.g. in Kubernetes or Openshift environments these information should be stored in secrets.
The following subchapters describe which information should be protected and how this can be achieved.

#### Secure handling of license and passphrase
It is possible to use the following parameters of this Helm chart to configure license and passphrase:
* License: `config.generic.license`
* Passphrase: `config.generic.passphrase`

The Helm chart itself creates a secret and configures the Microgateway to use it. While this is already secure, because it is stored as a secret, this information might end in a Git repo or somewhere else, where too many people have access to it.
This is why it is better to create a secret containing license and passphrase using a different process.

  The example below shows how to create a secret containing license and passphrase.
  ```
  kubectl create secret generic microgateway-secrets --from-file=license=<license_file> --from-file=passphrase=<passphrase_file>
  ```

  Afterwards use this secret in the Helm chart configuration file.
  custom-values.yaml
  ```
  config:
    generic:
      existingSecret: "microgateway-secrets"
  ```

#### Credentials to pull image from Docker registry
The Microgateway image is published in a private Docker registry to which only granted accounts have access.
In order to download this image, the credentials must be configured in a secret and passed to the Helm chart to use when downloading the image.

  The example below shows how to create a secret with the credentials to download the image from the Docker registry.
  ```
  kubectl create secret docker-registry docker-secret --docker-username=<username> --docker-password=<access_token>
  ```

  Afterwards use this secret in the Helm chart configuration file.
  custom-values.yaml
  ```
  imagePullSecrets: 
      - name: "docker-secret"
  ```

#### Certificates for Microgateway
The Microgateway can be configured to use a specific certificate for frontend and/or backend connections. The certificate must be stored in a secret 
and passed to the Helm chart to use it.

Used for frontend connection:
* Certificate: `tls.crt`
* Private key: `tls.key`
* CA:          `ca.crt`

:exclamation: In case that [Route Re-encrypt configuration](#route-re-encrypt-configuration) is used, ensure that `route.tls.destinationCACertificate` is updated accordingly.

Used for backend connection:
* Certificate: `backend-client.crt`
* Private key: `backend-client.key`
* CA:          `backend-server-validation-ca.crt`


  The example below shows how to create a secret containing certificates for frontend and backend connections.
  ```
  kubectl create secret generic microgateway-tls \
                                --from-file=tls.crt=<frontend_cert_file> \
                                --from-file=tls.key=<frontend_key_file> \
                                --from-file=ca.crt=<frontend_ca_file> \
                                --from-file=backend-client.crt=<backend_cert_file> \
                                --from-file=backend-client.key=<backend_key_file> \
                                --from-file=backend-ca.crt=<backend_ca_file>
  ```

  Afterwards use this secret in the Helm chart configuration file.
  custom-values.yaml
  ```
  config:
    generic:
      tlsSecretName: "microgateway-tls"
  ```
