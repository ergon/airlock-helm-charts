## Introduction
This Helm chart bootstraps [Airlock Microgateway](https://www.airlock.com) on a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) or [Openshift](https://www.openshift.com) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager. It provisions an Airlock Microgateway pod with a default configuration which can be adjusted to customer needs. For more details about the configuration options, see chapter [Helm Configuration](#dsl-configuration).

## Prerequisites
* The Airlock Microgateway image
* A valid license for Airlock Microgateway
* Redis service for sessionhandling (see chapter [Dependencies](#dependencies))

## Quick start guide

The following subchapters describe how to use the Helm chart.

### Adding the chart repository

To add the chart repository:

```console
helm repo add airlock https://ergon.github.io/airlock-helm-charts/
```

### Installing the chart

To install the chart with the release name `microgateway`:

```console
helm upgrade -i microgateway airlock/microgateway
```

### Uninstalling the chart

To uninstall the chart with the release name `microgateway`:

```console
helm uninstall microgateway
```

## Configuration

The following table lists configuration parameters of the Airlock Microgateway chart and the default values.

{{ template "chart.valuesTable" . }}

## Getting started with Helm

This chapter provides information to get started with Helm.

### Override the default values

The Airlock Microgateway Helm chart has many parameters and most of them have default values (see [Configuration](#configuration)). Depending on the environment, the defaults must be adapted. To override the default values, do the following:

* Create a yaml file which contains the values differ to the default.
* Apply this yaml file with the `-f` parameter.

**Example:**

The example below shows how certain default values could be adjusted.

  custom-values.yaml
  ```
  config:
    default:
      backend:
        hostname: other-service
    existingSecret: "microgateway-secrets"
  imagePullSecrets:
    - name: "docker-secret"
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    hosts:
      - example.virtinc.com
  ```

Afterwards apply the Helm chart configuration file with the `-f` parameter.
```console
helm upgrade -i microgateway airlock/microgateway -f custom-values.yaml
```

:point_up: **YAML indentation**:<br>
YAML is very strict with indetation. To ensure that the YAML file itself is correct, check it's content with a YAML validator (e.g. [YAML Lint](http://www.yamllint.com/)).

## Dependencies

The Airlock Microgateway Helm chart has the following optional dependencies, which can be enabled for an easy start.

{{ template "chart.requirementsTable" . }}

### Redis

In case that session handling is enabled on Airlock Microgateway, a Redis service needs to be available. The Airlock Microgateway Helm chart has two options:
* To deploy the dependend Redis service, adapt the Helm chart configuration as shown below:
  custom-values.yaml
  ```
  redis:
    enabled: true
  ```
* To use an existing Redis service, adapt the Helm chart configuration as shown below:
  custom-values.yaml
  ```
  config:
    redisService:
      - <REDIS-SERVICE1>:<PORT>
      - <REDIS-SERVICE2>:<PORT>
  redis:
    enabled: false
  ```

Finally, apply the Helm chart configuration file with `-f` parameter.

```console
helm upgrade -i microgateway airlock/microgateway -f custom-values.yaml
```

:information_source: **Possible settings**:<br>
Please refer to the [Redis Helm chart](https://hub.helm.sh/charts/bitnami/redis) to see all possible parameters of the Redis Helm chart.

:warning: **Adjustments of the default settings**:<br>
Please note that the dependend Redis service has been tested with the settings this Helm chart is delivered. Adjusting those settings can cause issues.

### Echo-Server

For the first deployment it could be very useful to have a backend service processing requests. For this purpose the dependend echo-server can be deployed by doing the following:
  custom-values.yaml
  ```
  echo-server:
    enabled: true
  ```

Finally, apply the Helm chart configuration file with `-f` parameter.

```console
helm upgrade -i microgateway airlock/microgateway -f custom-values.yaml
```

:information_source: **Possible settings**:<br>
Please refer to the [Echo-Server Helm chart](https://ealenn.github.io/Echo-Server/pages/helm.html) to see all possible parameters of the Echo-Server Helm chart.

## DSL configuration

The Helm chart provides three different possibilities to configure the Microgateway DSL.
Depending on the environment and use case, another option might suit better and is easier to implement.

### Simple DSL configuration

The simple DSL configuration suites best for the following use case:
* Virtual Host 1: abc.com -> Mapping 1: / -> Backend Service 1

This means that:
* Only one Virtual Host is configured.
* The Mapping configuration is applied to all requests sent to the backend service.
* There is only one backend service.



The Helm chart provides a simple configuration which can be adjusted with the `config.default.*` parameters.
All settings have already configured a default value. So only the values which differ from the default value have to be configured. 


**Example:**

custom-values.yaml
```
config:
  IPHeader:
    trustedProxies:
      - 10.0.0.0/28
  default:
    mapping:
      entryPath: /
    backend:
      hostname: custom-backend

redis:
  enabled: true
```

**Parameters which can be used**:
* All `config.*` parameters can be used.
  * When using the `config.redisService` parameter:
    * The Mapping will be configured with "enforce_session", except `config.default.mapping.sessionHandling` is configured.
  * When using the `redis.enabled` parameter:
    * The Mapping will be configured with "enforce_session", except `config.default.mapping.sessionHandling` is configured.
  

**Parameters which cannot be used**:
* The `config.apps` parameter cannot be used. This would switch to the [Advanced DSL app configuration](#advanced-dsl-app-configuration)
* The `config.dsl` parameter cannot be used. This would switch to the [Expert DSL app configuration](#expert-dsl-app-configuration)


### Advanced DSL app configuration

In case that the [Simple DSL configuration](#simple-dsl-configuration) does not suite, the advanced configuration options might help. The following use cases might require this kind of configuration:


**_Use Case 1)_**
* Virtual Host 1: abc.com -> Mapping 1: / -> Backend Service 1
* Virtual Host 2: xyz.com -> Mapping 2: / -> Backend Service 1

**_Use Case 2)_**
* Virtual Host 1: abc.com -> Mapping 1: /      -> Backend Service 1
                          -> Mapping 2: /auth/ -> Backend Service 1

**_Use Case 3)_**
* Virtual Host 1: abc.com -> Mapping 1: / -> Backend Service 1
* Virtual Host 2: xyz.com -> Mapping 2: / -> Backend Service 2

These use cases are only examples which could also occur slightly different. But all of them have in common that they have more than one Virtual Hosts, Mappings or Backend Services. Whenever this is the case, the [Advanced DSL app configuration](#advanced-dsl-app-configuration) should be preferred over the [Simple DSL configuration](#simple-dsl-configuration).


**Example:**

custom-values.yaml
```
config:
  IPHeader:
    trustedProxies:
      - 10.0.0.0/28
  apps:
    - virtual_host:
        hostname: virtinc.com
      mappings:
        - name: webapp
          entry_path: /
          operational_mode: integartion
          session_handling: enforce_session
        - name: api
          entry_path: /api/
          session_handling: ignore_session
          openapi:
            spec_file: /config/virtinc_api_openapi.json
      backend:
        hostname: custom-backend

redis:
  enabled: true
```

**Parameters which can be used**:
* `config.apps` - **must** be used.
* `config.*`
* Only the following `config.default.*` parameters:
  * `config.default.virtualHost.tls.*`
  * `config.default.backend.tls.*`

**Parameters which cannot be used**:
* `config.dsl` - This would switch to the [Expert DSL app configuration](#expert-dsl-app-configuration)
* `config.default.mapping.*`
* `config.default.backend.protocol`
* `config.default.backend.hostname`
* `config.default.backend.port`

### Expert DSL configuration

In case that the [Advanced DSL app configuration](#advanced-dsl-app-configuration) does not suite, the expert configuration options must be used. There are a few reasons listed below:

* Microgateway DSL configuration options must be set and are not available as Helm chart parameters (e.g. base_template_file, session.store_mode, ...)
* The same Microgateway DSL configuration file has been used elsewhere. The same configuration should be used.


**Example:**

custom-values.yaml
```
config:
  dsl:
    base_template_file: /config/custom-base.xml
    license_file: /secret/config/license
    session:
      encryption_passphrase_file: /secret/config/passphrase
      redis_host: 
        - redis-master
    log:
      level: info
    expert_settings:
      apache: |
        RemoteIPHeader X-Forwarded-For
        RemoteIPInternalProxy 10.0.0.0/28
      
    apps: 
      - virtual_host:
          hostname: virtinc.com
        mappings:
          - name: webapp
            entry_path: /
            operational_mode: integartion
            session_handling: enforce_session
          - name: api
            entry_path: /api/
            session_handling: ignore_session
            openapi:
              spec_file: /config/virtinc_api_openapi.json
        backend:
          hostname: backend-service

redis:
  enabled: true

```

**Parameters which can be used**:
* `config.dsl` - **must** be used.
* `config.env`
* `config.license`
* `config.passphrase`
* `config.tlsSecretName`

**Parameters which cannot be used**:
* `config.apps`
* `config.default.*`
* All other `config.*` parameters not mentioned that they are available.

## Security (TBD)

### Hardening (TBD)

### Deny Rule Handling (TBD)

### Secrets
Several different Secrets are required to configure the Microgateway properly.  
Some of these secrets can be generated during the installation of the chart, others must be created in advance and then referenced in the Microgateway chart.   
The following examples show how to create a secret and how to use it with the Microgateway.  

#### existingSecret
This secret contains the license and the passphrase (for encryption). 
For example, this secret can be created as follows:
```
kubectl create secret generic microgatewaysecrets --from-file=license=license_file --from-file=passphrase=passphrase_file
```
This secret can then be used with the following custom-values.yaml configuration:
```
config:
  existingSecret: "microgatewaysecrets"
```

#### imagePullSecrets
To download the Microgateway image from a private docker repository, an imagePullSecret is required.
For example, this secret can be created as follows:
```
kubectl create secret docker-registry dockersecret --docker-username=<Username> --docker-password=<Access_Token>
```
This secret can then be used with the following custom-values.yaml configuration:
```
imagePullSecrets: 
    - name: "dockersecret"
```

#### tlsSecretName 
The TLS certificates that are used by the Microgateway can be stored in a secret, so that only the secret name needs to be specified during deployment.  
Microgateway certificates include both Virtual Host TLS certificates and the TLS certificates for the backend if the backend is to be connected via TLS.  
Depending on the desired TLS configuration, other certificates are required in Secret.   
Virtual Host TLS needs the keys `tls.crt`, `tls.key` and `ca.crt`. Make sure to update `route.tls.destinationCACertificate` accordingly, if used.  
Backend TLS needs the keys `backend-client.crt`, `backend-client.key` and `backend-server-validation-ca.crt`.  

For example, this secret can be created as follows:
```
kubectl create secret generic microgatewaytls --from-file=tls.crt=virtinc-tls.crt --from-file=tls.key=virtinc-tls.key --from-file=ca.crt=virtinc-ca.crt
```
This secret can then be used with the following custom-values.yaml configuration:
```
config:
  tlsSecretName: "microgatewaytls"
```

## Examples
Here are some examples of how the Microgateway could be installed.   
Depending on the requirements and knowledge level, one or the other example may be more suitable for your environment.  

### DSL Configuration Examples
The chapter [DSL Configuration](#dsl-configuration) already described how to configure the DSL with the Helm chart.   
In the following chapters, various examples of these configuration options are given to help you better understand the DSL mechanism in order to use it as efficiently as possible.  
Depending on the requirements of the Microgateway configuration, a different DSL must be created.   

#### Simple setup example 
The Simple Setup assumes that it has a virtual host, mapping and backend each.   
For the Simple Setup all settings `config.*` are available.  
Thus, the user does not have to write and provide his own DSL. The generation of the DSL with the required values is done by the Helm chart.  

simple-values.yaml
```
config:
  default:
    mapping:
      operationalMode: integration
      denyRules:
        level: strict
    backend:
      hostname: backend-hostname
  logLevel: trace
```

#### Advanced setup example
The Advanced setup should be used if the settings of the Simple Setup are no longer sufficient.  
Therefore, if more than one virtual host, mapping and backend is needed, or if the app requires different settings than those that can be set with the `config.default.*`.   
Please note that a valid DSL app must be specified and the values config.default.* are no longer used.   

The following two examples show a possible use case where you could choose the Advanced Setup.  

Multiple Mappings:
```
apps:
  - backend:
      hostname: backend-hostname
      protocol: https
    mappings:
      - name: root
      - name: example
        entry_path: /example/
        operational_mode: integration
```

Deny Rule exceptions:
```
apps:
  - backend:
      hostname: backend-hostname
      protocol: https
    mappings:
      - name: root
        deny_rules:
          - level: strict
            exceptions:
              - parameter_name:
                  pattern: $exception.*parameter^
                parameter_value:
                  pattern: $exception.*value^  
```

#### Expert setup example
In the expert setup you must dispense of all config.* settings of the Helm chart, with the exception of the config.dsl setting.  
This means that if you have DSL requirements that cannot be covered by the first two setups, you can specify your own DSL.   

### External connectivity
This section describes how the external connectivity can be configured.   
There are two different scenarios if you are on Kubernetes or if you want to install on Openshift.   
On Kubernetes an Ingress Controller is used and on Openshift a Route object.   

### Kubernetes Ingress
In the Kubernetes environments an Ingress Controller is required to make the Microgateway accessible from the Internet.  
In our examples we will use the nginx-ingress-controller. However, this is not installed directly with the Helm chart.   
The Helm chart only offers the possibility to create the required configuration for an existing Ingress Controller.   
If no ingress controller is available in an environment, it can be installed with Helm.   

[nginx-ingress](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/nginx-ingress)
```
helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com
helm install nginx stable/nginx-ingress
```

#### Without TLS
The following configuration example shows how the Ingress can be configured without TLS.  

```
ingress:
  enabled: true
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
  hosts:
      - virtinc.com
```

#### TLS Configuration
An Ingress can be protected with a Secret, which contains the TLS certificates.  
Currently the Ingress only supports a single TLS port, 443, and assumes TLS termination.  
If the TLS configuration section in an Ingress specifies different hosts, they are bundled on the same port according to the SNI-TLS extension.  

The following configuration example shows how the Ingress can be configured with TLS.
```
ingress:
  enabled: true
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
  targetPort: https
  tls:
    - secretName: virtinc-tls-secret
      hosts:
        - virtinc.com
```

### Openshift Route
In Openshift a route is needed to reach the Microgateway from the Internet.
A route object must be created for its configuration. The creation of such an object is handled by the Microgateway Helm chart.  

#### Without TLS
This example shows how to configure a route object without TLS using the Helm chart.

```
route:
  enabled: true
  hosts:
    - virtinc.com
  targetPort: http
  tls:
    enabled: false
```

#### TLS Configuration
There are three different TLS configuration options for the openshift route. These are edge, reencrypt and passthrough.  
Below is a description of how these options can be configured using the Microgateway chart.  

Evtl. nur eine Möglichkeit. 
There are two different options for specifying TLS certificates in the Helm chart.   
Either you create a secret (config.tlsSecretName) containing the required certificates or you provide the certificates in a custom-values.yaml file during deployment.   

##### Edge
With the edge termination TLS is terminated on the router.   
The TLS certificates are served by the router and must therefore be configured on the router.   

```
route:
  enabled: true
  hosts:
    - virtinc.com
  tls:
    enabled: true
    termination: edge
    certificate: |
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

      -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----       
```

##### Reencrypt
Reencrypt is similar to edge termination, because TLS termination takes place on the router.  
However, with reencrypt the connection is encrypted again before the request is sent to the Microgateway service.   
This means that the entire path of the connection is encrypted, including the internal network.   

```
route:
  enabled: true
  hosts:
    - virtinc.com
  tls:
    enabled: true
    certificate: |
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

      K0RRA/rDxZnkbvtTd+hkoMu3Or+pqpOrp2n1pbtzoVl9Hg==
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

##### Passthrough
When Passthrough is configured, the encrypted traffic is sent directly to the Microgateway without being terminated on the route.   
This means that no certificate needs to be configured on the route and termination takes place only on the Microgateway.  

```
route:
  enabled: true
  path: ""
  hosts:
    - virtinc.com
  tls:
    enabled: true
    termination: passthrough
```

## Environment variables
With the Helm chart environment variables can be set.   
These can then be used in the DSL configuration.   
Below is an example of how to set environment variables and then use them in the DSL.   

env-variables.yaml
```
config:
  env:
    - name: WAF_CFG_OPERATIONALMODE
      value: production
    - name: WAF_CFG_LOGONLY
      value: false
```

dsl-values.yaml
```
config:
  default: 
    mapping:
      operationalMode: "@@WAF_CFG_OPERATIONALMODE@@"
      denyRules:
        logOnly: "@@WAF_CFG_LOGONLY@@"
```

## Probes
In Kubernetes and Openshift probes are used to determine if a pod is ready to process requests or not.  

### Liveness Probe
The liveness Probe is used to find out when to restart a Pod.   
If a liveness Probe fails, the Pod will restart.   

The Helm chart has already predefined a liveness probe.   
If this does not work, it can be adjusted as follows.   

```
livenessProbe:
  initialDelaySeconds: 120
```

The liveness Probe can be disabled with `livenessProbe.enabled=false`  
Then the default of the environment on which the Microgateway is deployed is applied.   

### Readiness Probe
The readiness Probe is used to set the status of a pod to Ready. This means that the pod is now ready to process requests.  
If a readiness Probe fails, only the Ready status of the Pod is removed.   

The Helm chart has already predefined a readiness probe.   
If this does not work, it can be adjusted as follows.   

```
readinessProbe:
  initialDelaySeconds: 90
```

The readiness Probe can be disabled with `readinessProbe.enabled=false`  
Then the default of the environment on which the Microgateway is deployed is applied.
