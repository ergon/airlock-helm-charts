## Introduction
This Helm chart bootstraps [Airlock Microgateway](https://www.airlock.com) on a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) or [Openshift](https://www.openshift.com) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager. It provisions an Airlock Microgateway Pod with a default configuration that can be adjusted to customer needs. For more details about the configuration options, see chapter [Helm Configuration](#dsl-configuration).

## Prerequisites
* The Airlock Microgateway image
* Airlock Microgateway is available as premium and community edition. <br>
  Without a valid license, Airlock Microgateway works as community edition with limited functionality. <br>
  For further information refer to [Microgateway Documentation](https://docs.airlock.com/microgateway/latest/). <br>
  To order a license, please contact sales@airlock.com.
* Redis service for session handling (see chapter [Dependencies](#dependencies))

## Getting started
This chapter provides information how to get started with the Helm chart.

### Configure a valid license
This section describes how to configure a license for the Microgateway. By following the steps below, the Helm chart creates a secret with the license which is used by the Microgateway.

1. Create a license.yaml file, which has the following content:
```
---
config:
  license:
    key: |
      -----BEGIN LICENSE-----
      eJxFkEnTokgURf+LWzsCEBCpiFowKoMg8KUIZS8YUoZUEkgmqaj/XnYvqpbv
      [...]
      bHy/N5tf//76DY17EVk=
      -----END LICENSE-----
```

2. [Create the image pull secret](#credentials-to-pull-image-from-docker-registry) to pull the microgateway image.
3. Deploy the Microgateway with the license.yaml file:
  ```console
  helm upgrade -i microgateway airlock/microgateway -f license.yaml
  ```

:information_source: **Note**:<br>
In productive environments, licenses might be deployed and handled in a different lifecycles. In such cases, an existing license secret may be referenced. Further information is provided in chapter [Secure handling of license and passphrase](#secure-handling-of-license-and-passphrase).

### Override default values
The Airlock Microgateway Helm chart has many parameters and most of them are already equipped with default values (see [Configuration](#configuration)). Depending on the environment, the defaults must be adapted. To override default values, do the following:

* Create a YAML file that contains the values that differ to the default.
* Apply this YAML file with the `-f` parameter.

**Example:**

  custom-values.yaml
  ```
  config:
    dsl:
      session:
        redis_hosts: [redis-master]
      log:
        level: info
      remote_ip:
        header: X-Forwarded-For
        internal_proxies:
          - 10.0.0.0/28

      apps:
        - mappings:
            - session_handling: enforce_session
              deny_rule_groups:
                - level: strict

  imagePullSecrets:
    - name: "dockersecret"
  redis:
    enabled: true
  echo-server:
    enabled: true
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    annotations:
      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
      kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    hosts:
        - micro-echo
  ```

  Afterwards apply the Helm chart configuration file with the `-f` parameter.
  ```console
  helm upgrade -i microgateway airlock/microgateway -f custom-values.yaml
  ```

:point_up: **YAML indentation**:<br>
YAML is very strict with indentation. To ensure that the YAML file itself is correct, check it's content with a YAML validator (e.g. [YAML Lint](http://www.yamllint.com/)).

## Dependencies
The Airlock Microgateway Helm chart has the following optional dependencies, which can be enabled for a smooth start.

| Repository | Name | Version |
|------------|------|---------|
| https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami | redis | 10.6.12 |
| https://ealenn.github.io/charts | echo-server | 0.3.0 |

### Redis
In case that session handling is enabled on Airlock Microgateway, a Redis service needs to be available. The Airlock Microgateway Helm chart has two options:
* To deploy the dependent Redis service, adapt the Helm chart configuration as shown below:
  custom-values.yaml
  ```
  redis:
    enabled: true
  config:
    dsl:
      session:
        redis_hosts: [redis-master]
  ```
* To use an existing Redis service, adapt the Helm chart configuration as shown below:
  custom-values.yaml
  ```
  redis:
    enabled: false
  config:
    dsl:
      session:
        redis_hosts: [<REDIS-SERVICE>:<PORT>]
  ```

Finally, apply the Helm chart configuration file with `-f` parameter.

  ```console
  helm upgrade -i microgateway airlock/microgateway -f custom-values.yaml
  ```

:information_source: **Possible settings**:<br>
Please refer to the [Redis Helm chart](https://hub.helm.sh/charts/bitnami/redis) to see all possible parameters of the Redis Helm chart.

:warning: **Adjustments of the default settings**:<br>
The delivered Helm chart comes pre-configured and tested for the dependent Redis service. Adjusting those settings can cause issues.

### Echo-Server
For the first deployment, it could be very useful to have a backend service processing requests. For this purpose the dependent Echo-Server can be deployed by doing the following:
  custom-values.yaml
  ```
  echo-server:
    enabled: true
  ```

Finally, apply the Helm chart configuration file with `-f` parameter.

  ```console
  helm upgrade -i microgateway airlock/microgateway -f custom-values.yaml
  ```

:information_source: **Possible settings**:<br>
Please refer to the [Echo-Server Helm chart](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/ealenn/echo-server) to see all possible parameters of the Echo-Server Helm chart.

## DSL Configuration
It is possible to use all Microgateway DSL configuration options within the 'dsl' configuration parameter.

For a full list of available Microgateway configuration parameters refer to the [Microgateway Documentation](https://docs.airlock.com/microgateway/latest/)

**Example:**

  custom-values.yaml
  ```
  config:
    dsl:
      session:
        redis_hosts: [redis-master]
      log:
        level: info
      remote_ip:
        header: X-Forwarded-For
        internal_proxies:
          - 10.0.0.0/28

      apps:
        - virtual_host:
            hostname: virtinc.com
          mappings:
            - name: webapp
              entry_path:
                value: /
              operational_mode: integration
              session_handling: enforce_session
            - name: api
              entry_path:
                value: /api/
              session_handling: ignore_session
              openapi:
                spec_file: /config/virtinc_api_openapi.json
              backend:
                hosts:
                  - protocol: https
                    name: custom-backend-service
                    port: 8443

  redis:
    enabled: true

  ```

## Environment Variables
### DSL Environment Variables
Environment variables can be configured with the Helm chart and used within the [DSL Configuration](#dsl-configuration).
The example below illustrates how to configure environment variables in combination with the [DSL configuration](#dsl-configuration).

  env-variables.yaml
  ```
  config:
    env:
      configbuilder:
        - name: OPERATIONAL_MODE
          value: integration
        - name: DR_LOG_ONLY
          value: true
  ```

  custom-values.yaml
  ```
  config:
    dsl:
      apps:
        - virtual_host:
            hostname: virtinc.com
          mappings:
            - name: webapp
              operational_mode: ${OPERATIONAL_MODE:-production}
              deny_rules:
                log_only: ${DR_LOG_ONLY:-false}
  ```

Finally, apply the Helm chart configuration file with `-f` parameter.

  ```console
  helm upgrade -i microgateway airlock/microgateway -f custom-values.yaml -f env-variables.yaml
  ```

### Runtime Environment Variables
The Helm chart also allows to specify environment variables for the runtime container.
The following example shows how to set the timezone of the microgateway:

env-variables.yaml
```
config:
  env:
    runtime:
      - name: TZ
        value: Europe/Zurich
```

## Extra Volumes
The Helm chart allows you to define extra volumes which can be used in the Microgateway.
The configuration of such additional volumes could look like this:

```
extraVolumes:
  - name: mapping
    configMap:
      name: mapping-configmap
extraVolumeMounts:
  - name: mapping
    mountPath: /config/template/mapping.xml
    subPath: mapping.xml

config:
  dsl:
    apps:
    - virtual_host:
        hostname: virtinc.com
      mappings:
        - mapping_template_path: /config/template/mapping.xml
```

## Probes
Probes are used in Kubernetes and Openshift to determine if a Pod is ready and in good health to process requests.

### Readiness Probe
The readiness probe determines whether a Pod is ready to process requests. This means that requests are only forwarded to this Pod once it is in ready state.

The Helm chart is already pre-configured for the readiness probe endpoint of the Microgateway Pod. A huge Microgateway configuration could require to increase the initial delay time. This can be accomplished by configuring the following parameter:

  ```
  readinessProbe:
    initialDelaySeconds: 90
  ```

If desired, the readiness probe can be disabled with `readinessProbe.enabled=false`. This way, the Pod is ready immediately and receives requests.

### Liveness Probe
The liveness Probe determines whether a Pod is in good health. If the liveness probe fails, the Pod is terminated and new one is started.

The Helm chart is already pre-configured for the liveness probe endpoint of the Microgateway Pod. A huge Microgateway configuration could require to increase the initial delay time. This can be accomplished by configuring the following parameter:

  ```
  livenessProbe:
    initialDelaySeconds: 120
  ```

If desired, the liveness probe can be disabled with `livenessProbe.enabled=false`.

## External connectivity
The Helm chart can be configured to create a Kubernetes Ingress or Openshift Route to pass external traffic to the Microgateway Pod.
In case that those objects have to be created with this Helm chart, just follow along with the description and configuration examples.
If there is already an existing Ingress or Route object and the traffic should only be passed to the Microgateway service, the information in the subchapters should provide useful information about how to integrate into the existing environment.

:information_source: **Kubernetes vs. Openshift**:<br>
This Helm chart can be used for Kubernetes and Openshift. While Kubernetes has "Ingress" and Openshift has "Route", simply enable the feature which fits to the environment (e.g. in Kubernetes `ingress.enabled=true` and in Openshift `route.enabled=true`).

### Kubernetes Ingress
Kubernetes allows using different kinds of Ingress controllers. Our examples are based on the [nginx-ingress](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx) controller.

  The example below shows how to install the nginx-ingress-controller with Helm:
  ```
  helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
  helm repo update

  helm install nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx
  ```

:information_source: **Note**:<br>
The Microgateway Helm chart itself does not install the nginx-ingress-controller, but allows to create an Ingress object.

#### Ingress terminating HTTP

  To receive HTTP traffic from the outside of the Kubernetes cluster, use the following configuration:
  ```
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    annotations:
      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
      kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    hosts:
        - virtinc.com
  ```

#### Ingress terminating secure HTTPS
The TLS certificate of the Ingress must be in a secret object which is referred to in the Ingress configuration.
At the time of writing, Ingress supports only the default port 443 for HTTPS and directly assumes it is TLS.
In case that multiple hosts are configured, TLS-SNI is used to distinguish what host the client requested.
For each configured `ingress.tls.host`, an `ingress.hosts` entry must also be created to ensure that the ingress rules are created correctly.

  To receive HTTPS traffic from the outside of the Kubernetes cluster, use the following configuration:
  ```
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    annotations:
      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
      kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: https
    targetPort: https
    tls:
      - secretName: virtinc-tls-secret
        hosts:
          - virtinc.com
    hosts:
      - virtinc.com
  ```

### Openshift Route
Since the Route controller is already available in an Openshift environment, nothing has to be installed additionally.

#### Route terminating HTTP

  To receive HTTP traffic from the outside of the Openshift cluster, use the following configuration:
  ```
  route:
    enabled: true
    hosts:
      - virtinc.com
    targetPort: http
    tls:
      enabled: false
  ```

#### Route terminating secure HTTPS
Openshift has three different TLS termination types that can be used. Edge, re-encrypt and passthrough.
The subchapters provide the required information to configure it, using the Microgateway Helm chart.

##### Route Edge configuration
With the TLS termination type "Edge", HTTPS traffic is terminated on the Openshift Router.
Therefore, a valid certificate for the specified hosts must be applied.

  To setup Edge TLS termination, use the following configuration:
  ```
  route:
    enabled: true
    hosts:
      - virtinc.com
    tls:
      enabled: true
      termination: edge
      certificate: |
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        MIIDizCCAnOgAwIBAgIJAMQE1QewYs4QMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMFwxCzAJBgNV
        [...]
        77RRptcoQJPvw50z9rJ4wkrb58raUKOqxgvpckQdYdtok0dR6tXbBfC4LHmqq0mo
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
      key: |
        -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
        MIIEpAIBAAKCAQEAtXkTjHtDtutxyo1R6N4Eh18IzxoagAHPRzsdB5yeadcVr/bV
        [...]
        pGKu7aodwB4cD5YnfXTvUcTv5tNU0llRLG1J0bg1n9cCo0nTC9sUZw==
        -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
  ```

##### Route Re-encrypt configuration
With the TLS termination type "Re-encrypt", HTTPS is terminated on the Openshift Router and re-encrypted to the Microgateway service.
Because the default in the Microgateway Helm chart for `route.targetPort` is `https`, traffic inside the Openshift cluster is by default encrypted.
The difference to TLS termination type "Edge" is:
* The Microgateway certificate is validated against `route.tls.destinationCACertificate`.
* It is enforced, that `route.targetPort=https` (Edge would also work with `route.targetPort=http`)

In other words, the entire path of the connection is encrypted and verified, also within the Openshift cluster.

  To setup Re-encrypt TLS termination, use the following configuration:
  ```
  route:
    enabled: true
    hosts:
      - virtinc.com
    tls:
      enabled: true
      certificate: |
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        MIIDizCCAnOgAwIBAgIJAMQE1QewYs4QMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMFwxCzAJBgNV
        [...]
        77RRptcoQJPvw50z9rJ4wkrb58raUKOqxg4Jn=
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
      key: |
        -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
        MIIEpAIBAAKCAQEAtXkTjHtDtutxyo1R6N4Eh18IzxoagAHPRzsdB5yeadcVr/bV
        [...]
        pGKu7aodwB4cD5YnfXTvUcTv5tNU0llRLG1J0bg1n9cCo0nTC9sUZw==
        -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
      destinationCACertificate: |
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        MIIDrIXdz54xcilsKUoepQkn9e0bmIUVuiXWcQrr8iqjYC+hINNmiq+4YX4lWq2M
        [...]
        K0RRA/rDxZnkbvtTd+hkoMu3Or+pqpOrp2n1pbtzoVl9Hg==
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  ```

##### Route Passthrough configuration
With the TLS termination type "Passthrough", HTTPS traffic is sent directly to the Microgateway, without decrypting it on the route.
Therefore, no certificates need to be configured on the Route and termination takes place in the Microgateway.

  To setup Passthrough TLS termination, use the following configuration:
  ```
  route:
    enabled: true
    path: ""
    hosts:
      - virtinc.com
    tls:
      enabled: true
      termination: passthrough
      destinationCACertificate: ""
  ```

#### Hostnames Generated by Openshift
Openshift assigns an automatically generated hostname to a route if you do not provide one.
You can achieve this by specifying an empty string as hostname.

```
route:
  enabled: true
  path: ""
  hosts:
    - ""
```

## Security
The following subchapters describes how to use and securely deploy the Microgateway.

### Store sensitive information in secrets
Airlock Microgateway uses sensitive information that should be protected accordingly. E.g. in Kubernetes or Openshift environments this information should be stored in secrets.
The following subchapters describe which information should be protected and how this can be achieved.

#### Secure handling of license and passphrase
It is possible to use the following parameters of this Helm chart to configure a license and an encryption passphrase:
* License: `config.license.*`
* Passphrase: `config.passphrase.*`

Depending on the settings of the previous parameters, the Helm chart itself creates a secret or uses an existing one and configures the Microgateway to use it. Storing sensitive information in secrets is best practise and also secure. Nevertheless, ensure that these secrets are not stored in Git where too many people have access to it.
The license has an expiry date and might be used for a Microgateway protecting several web applications while every web application might have its own passphrase. In other words, most likely the license has a different lifecycle than the passphrase which is why they should be stored in different secrets.

##### Creating and referencing external secrets

  The example below shows how to create a secret containing both the license and the passphrase.
  ```
  kubectl create secret generic microgateway-passphrase --from-file=passphrase=<passphrase_file>
  kubectl create secret generic microgateway-license --from-file=license=<license_file>
  ```

  Afterwards reference this secret in the Helm chart configuration file.

  ```
  config:
    passphrase:
      useExistingSecret: true
      secretName: "microgateway-passphrase"
    license:
      useExistingSecret: true
      secretName: "microgateway-license"     
  ```

##### Creating secrets with the Helm Chart
The example below shows how to create secrets for the passphrase and the license using the Helm Chart.

```
config:
  passphrase:
    value: "my-passphrase"
  license:
    key: |
      -----BEGIN LICENSE-----
      <my-license>
      -----END LICENSE-----
```

#### Credentials to pull image from Docker registry
The Microgateway image is published on our Docker Hub repository. The repository itself is public and the image can be pulled without special permissions.
Nevertheless, Docker has [rate limits](https://www.docker.com/increase-rate-limits) for anonymous users in place. Therefore, it is recommended to use an Docker Hub account to pull the image.
In order to download this image, the Helm chart needs the Docker credentials to authenticate against the Docker registry.
Either an already existing Docker secret is provided (`imagePullSecrets`) during the installation of the Microgateway, or a Kubernetes secret is created with the provided credentials (`imageCredentials`).

  The example below shows how to create a secret with the credentials to download the image from the Docker registry.
  ```
  kubectl create secret docker-registry docker-secret --docker-username=<username> --docker-password=<access_token>
  ```

  Afterwards use this secret in the Helm chart configuration file.
  custom-values.yaml
  ```
  imagePullSecrets:
      - name: "docker-secret"
  ```

  The following example shows how to configure the Helm chart so that a Kubernetes credential is created.
```
imageCredentials:
  enabled: true
  username: <username>
  password: <access_token>
```

#### Certificates for Microgateway
The Microgateway can be configured to use a specific certificate for frontend and/or backend connections. The certificate must be stored in a secret
and passed to the Helm chart to use it.

Used for frontend connection:
* Certificate: `frontend-server.crt`
* Private key: `frontend-server.key`
* CA:          `frontend-server-ca.crt`

:exclamation: In case that [Route Re-encrypt configuration](#route-re-encrypt-configuration) is used, ensure that `route.tls.destinationCACertificate` is updated accordingly.

Used for backend connection:
* Certificate: `backend-client.crt`
* Private key: `backend-client.key`
* CA:          `backend-server-validation-ca.crt`

  The example below shows how to create a secret containing certificates for frontend and backend connections.
  ```
  kubectl create secret generic microgateway-tls \
                                --from-file=frontend-server.crt=<frontend_cert_file> \
                                --from-file=frontend-server.key=<frontend_key_file> \
                                --from-file=frontend-server-ca.crt=<frontend_ca_file> \
                                --from-file=backend-client.crt=<backend_cert_file> \
                                --from-file=backend-client.key=<backend_key_file> \
                                --from-file=backend-ca.crt=<backend_ca_file>
  ```

  Afterwards use this secret in the Helm chart configuration file.
  ```
  config:
    tlsSecretName: "microgateway-tls"
  ```

#### JWKS Service Secrets
JWKS Services can be configured to provide keys for decryption and signature verification of access tokens.
There are two types of JWKS services:
- Local JWKS Services use a static JWKS that is either provided inline in the DSL or through a secret that is mounted into the Microgateway.
- Remote JWKS Services retrieve JWKS files from a remote service.

##### Configure a local JWKS Service with a secret
Create a secret containing your JWKS file if it does not exist yet:
`kubectl create secret generic local-jwks --from-file=jwks.json=<jwks_file>`

:exclamation: A restart of the Microgateway is required in case of changes in the mounted JWKS secret.

Use the secret in the DSL to create a local JWKS service like this:
```
config:
  jwks:
    localJWKSSecretName: local-jwks
  dsl:
    apps:
        - mappings:
            access_token:
              ... your access token configuration ...
              jwks_providers:
                - jwks-local               
    jwks_providers:
      local:
        - name: jwks-local
          jwks_file:  /secret/jwks/jwks.json
```
##### Configure local JWKS services using extra volume mounts
Parametrization of the Helm Chart only allows to configure one local JWKS Service. For configuring more than one service,
the parameters `extraVolumes` and `extraVolumeMounts` may be used.
With extra volume mounts, JWKS files can be mounted to a path other than `/secret/jwks/jwks.json`.

See [Extra Volumes](#extra-volumes) for additional information and an example.

### Service Account
The Microgateway runs under a dedicated service account created with the deployment by default.
The following example shows how to use an existing service account instead of having one created in the deployment.
```
serviceAccount:
  create: false
  name: <existing service account>
```

## Deployment Smoketest
The following example shows how to run a smoke test against a microgateway deployment.
```
helm test <deployment_name>
```
The default URL for the test is '/'. Overwrite the test URL with the parameter 'test_request'.
```
test_request: /myapp/login
```
